title: Atom syntax theme

What better way to spend a day of convalescence than converting a syntax highlighting theme from Sublime Text to Atom?

Don't answer that.

After a variety of fruitless "convert sublime syntax theme atom" searches, I considered doing it by hand. Then I remembered that Sublime themes are just TextMate themes, and I found [this handy guide](https://atom.io/docs/v0.68.0/converting-a-text-mate-theme) in the Atom docs.

So, in the highly unlikely event that you've got the same sort of colour-blindness as me, you've got the [Spacegray Dark UI Theme](https://atom.io/packages/spacegray-dark-ui) and, while you consider it to look cool, you're finding the lack of visual contrast in the [base16 ocean spacegray dark theme](https://atom.io/packages/base16-ocean-spacegray) a little restrictive, this could be so far up your street, it's parked in your drive and ringing your doorbell.

In Atom, go to Preferencesâ€¦, click 'Themes' and search for 'dmc'. Listed, [here](https://atom.io/packages/dmc).

Yo!
