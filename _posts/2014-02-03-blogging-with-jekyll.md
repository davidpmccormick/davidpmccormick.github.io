title: Blogging with Jekyll
---

I've decided to get rid of sumnoise.com as it was; in its place, I'm going to try to keep a blog, documenting anything I've learned/am struggling with in the world of front-end development.

I got this up and running with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and GitHub pages, using a slightly modified version of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

From [the Jekyll readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

From [the Hyde readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/README.md):

> Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content.
