title: Squash commits
---

1. Work on a branch (`ugly_commits_branch`), not being afraid to commit all manner of total balls.
2. Checkout the master branch.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b rewrite_history_branch`
4. Squash-merge in the ugly stuff: `git merge --squash ugly_commits_branch`
5. Commit so it looks like you did everything right in the first place: `git commit -m "Add mad stylez, yo!"`
